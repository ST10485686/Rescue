## Overview
Neptune Claws & Paws Rescue is a hypothetical non-profit organisation dedicated to rescuing, rehabilitating, and rehoming abandoned cats and dogs in the Johannesburg area.  

Our mission is to provide a safe haven for animals in need and help them find forever homes.  
We operate primarily through a foster network and rely on donations and volunteers. Partnerships with veterinary clinics, sponsors, and animal shelters will ensure proper care for our animals.
